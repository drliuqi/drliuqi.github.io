Current methods frequently fail to account for scenarios where objects are frequently blocking the view, resulting in inaccurate identification of contact areas. To tackle this problem, we suggest using a perspective interaction HOT detector called PIHOT, which utilizes a depth map generation model to offer depth information of humans and objects related to the camera, thereby preventing false interaction detection. Furthermore, we use mask dilatation and object restoration techniques to restore the texture details in covered areas, improve the boundaries between objects, and enhance the perception of humans interacting with objects. Moreover, a spatial awareness perception is intended to concentrate on the characteristic features close to the points of contact. The experimental results show that the PIHOT algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets for HOT detection tasks. Compared to the most recent DHOT, our method enjoys an average improvement of 13%, 27.5%, 16%, and 18.5% on SC-Acc., C-Acc., mIoU, and wIoU metrics, respectively.}, number={8}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Wang, Yuxiao and Neng, Wenpeng and Wei, Zhenao and Lei, Yu and Xue, Weiying and Zhuang, Nan and Xu, Yanwu and Jiang, Xinyu and Liu, Qi}, year={2025}, month={Apr.}, pages={8187-8195} }
